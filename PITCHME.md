# Background

+++

## In two faire Branches forking fruitfully...
- 1605 J. Sylvester wrote the earliest known example of this particular fork as a verb
  - This fact requires verifaction and might be rather alternative

+++

- "The half life of the teaspoons was 81 days." [Aitken 2005](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.331.7531.1498)
- We lost 95% over 365 days (Van Mourik et al. 2014, in prep.) 
- Equivalent with fork half life of 84.5 days
- This result has been replicated twice
  - grant number [RIC Fall 2015](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15jg1YHpHG_-xchWnq9zHXQoU33K2eqEI97rbhe0TdVI) 
  - grant number [RIC Fall 2016](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JwDWR4ktyRerZ78i_v9WBSoHi2pvvsan2ejlBvIaXpU)

# Experimental Question
+++
- We hypothesise that the FFA has always been an acronym for the Fusiform Fork Area.
- After exploratory research we estimated the half-life of forks to be ...

## "F@!king Repos..."
- Forking a repo is a legitimate software terminology
- It refers to taking a copy of another person or group's software so as to continue development independently

+++

- The intention to contribute the change back at a later date is possible
- It is also possible to represent a split / schism in the developer community, with different aims


+++

## Forking someone's repository can be looked as praise
- It validates the user's software as being useful
- Also shows that you want to help continue it's development, and often voluntarily

## Don't forget about sporks...

# Procedure & Subjects

+++

- Equipment: 200 forks * ± €1
- The cost of GPS trackers, cost unknown. 
- Maybe the CNS department wants to chip in, as they’re also using the kitchen.

+++

- We will use the quills of a Porcupine [Porcupine](https://timvanmourik.github.io/Porcupine) as chopsticks. 
  - We will ask ethical approval for animal research 
  - We will request Da Betty e Mora to cook more Chinese

# Data Analysis

+++
-Multi-way ANOVA, we determine the F value (fork value)
  - If F < F_crit we will conclude that ...

MATLAB could not find them either:
```MATLAB
lost_at = 'DondersInstitute'
fork_loc = ft_findForks(forks, lost_at);
```
[Undefined function or variable 'forks'.]()

# Scientific Contribution

+++

# What we learnt from this process
- We built a presentation template (GitPitch)
  - easily create minimal online presentation
- Technical issues can easily be outsourced (GitCoin)

# May the forks be with you!
