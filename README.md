# ForkPPM
This presentation is a collaborative project that will be presented as a 15 minute pitch at the DCCN Project Proposal Meeting, a meeting at the neuoscience institute

The goal is
- to be a humurous 15 minute presentation about a request for forks in the Donders Kitchen
- to create a GitPitch template for future Donders PPMs
-- lame jokes referring to GitHub forks are much appreciated
- to be a fun way of get neuroscientists to use GitHub
- to be a way to see if [Gitcoin](gitcoin.co) could be useful for incentivising the collaboration

Pull Requests will preferably be accepted from novice GitHub users at the Donders Institute.
-the GitHub user is part of the [Donders Institute]()
